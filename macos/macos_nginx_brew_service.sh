[help information]

Description: üçé 
    This script is used to resolve the problem that the Homebrew-based Nginx package 
    daemon service cannot be started after the new version of MacOS is updated. This 
    problem is usually caused by the conflict between the permission privacy policy 
    updated by MacOS and the permission of the nginx daemon service. This script 
    manages the service by directly manipulating the nginx service process.

Notice:
	Before using the script, it is recommended to turn off the automatic running 
	of the nginx service after the operating system starts
	It is recommended to turn off the Nginx service and start up 
	(otherwise, privacy permission may be triggered if brew default 
	start service permission is too high after machine restart) Ôºö

	[ Example Cancel the system starting the self-loading nginx service ]

 	launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist

Command usage:

    -v|-V|version: Show current nginx version information.
    
    -h|-help|--help: Show help info.
    
    -s|s|status: Nginx process status.
    
    start|restart|reload|stop: Service operation.
